  HintTexts:
  - The goal is to create a stack of cards from low to high in each of the four foundation
    piles in the upper-right corner. Each pile can contain only one suit.
  - Aces are low and kings are high. The four foundation piles must begin with aces
    and end with kings.
  - You can move cards from one column to another. Cards in columns must be placed
    in descending order and must alternate between red and black.
  - Tap the deck in upper-left corner to draw more cards.
